# Automated-Machine-Learning
Automated machine learning is the process of automating the tasks of applying machine learning to real-world problems. AutoML potentially includes every stage from beginning with a raw dataset to building a machine learning model ready for deployment. These methods, if well understood can help small teams scale and large teams be more efficient.

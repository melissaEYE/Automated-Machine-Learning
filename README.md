# Automated-Machine-Learning
Automated machine learning is the process of automating the tasks of applying machine learning to real-world problems. AutoML potentially includes every stage from beginning with a raw dataset to building a machine learning model ready for deployment. These methods, if well understood can help small teams scale and large teams be more efficient.

The purpose of the analysis was to identify the bad vehicle purchases, from good vehicle purchases.  Furthermore, the dataset was used to examine models created in SAS Enterprise Miner (SAS-EM) to those in two different automated machine learning (AML) programs: Qlik AutoML and Data Robot . Specifically, data cleaning, model parameter inputs, cut-off decisions, results and evaluation of a “Champion” model are compared between the different software packages. 

The full report can be found in the file "Assignment6_Hunfalvay.pdf". This report shows a complete breakdown of my analysis, including problem identification, results, interpretations and software package analysis. Tables and visualizations are also included.
